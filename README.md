# random-password-generator

## Descripion

For this project I had starter code that I needed to make the JavaScript to make a randomly generated password. It needed to have the possibility to have numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or symbols. Through the use of prompts confirms and alerts I then had the information I needed to make the function generate the password to display for the end user.

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated

## Struggles and what i learned 

 The biggest struggle that I ran into during this project was understanding how the expression to randomly pick a value out of an array worked. By breaking it down into its smaller parts I learned exactly what was happening and why it does what it does. 

## Usage
If you click on Generate Password it will start some popup that you will answer. Follow the prompts and after the webpage will display a randomly generated password.
