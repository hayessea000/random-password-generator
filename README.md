# random-password-generator

## Descripion

<!-- For this project I started from scratch and built it into a portfolio using HTML and CSS code. Things that are included are my name, contact info, and a little bit about me. In addition to that some navigation links have been provided to get around the page. Then finally I added some of my work that has been provided with links to them. This page will adjust to fit most screens. -->

## technologys

The webpage uses HTML and CSS and JavaScript

## learned

<!-- I learned how to format items across a webpage and how to make the webpage display nicely on different resolution devices.  -->

## Task

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Struggles 

<!-- The biggest struggle that I ran into during this project was remembering to position the container box to where I wanted the items to go. Once I got into the habit of that everything went very smoothly.  -->

## Usage
<!-- Use the navagation links in the top right to get around the page. By clicking on the projects a new page will open to it. -->

# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
